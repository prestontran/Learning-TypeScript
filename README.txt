For this learning TypeScirpt project:

1. Make a tsconfig.js file with the following:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "sourceMap": true
  },
  "files": ["009_union_types.ts"] --Pass in the script name here
}

2. In terminal, run npm install -g typescript

3. Before running each script, type in "tsc 'sciprt name'" in terminal. This command will build a JS equipvalent file to the TS script

4. Type in "node 'script name'" without .ts in terminal. This command will run the individual TS file that we want to execute
